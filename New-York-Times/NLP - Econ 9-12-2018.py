para = "The world economy is in a deep recession. \
Two years have passed since America imposed tariffs on many of its trading partners, prompting retaliation from China, Canada, the European Union and others. \
Negotiations to resolve differences faltered amid tensions over trade surpluses and deficits. \
The effects of the protectionist measures seemed modest at first, when global economic growth was still fairly strong. \
But costs gradually started to add up for businesses and consumers. Investments faltered. Global supply chains choked. \
Then, in 2019, the American business cycle turned. \
In China, confidence in corporationsâ€™ ability to service debt fell. Financial markets plummeted. \
Surplus goods from China flooded into other markets, where pressure to raise import barriers became irresistible \
The downturn worsened. Job losses soared into the tens of millions. \
Pinging An boasts a booming health and life insurance businesses and technology first mindset with its focus on InsurTech and FinTech solutions. \
Yet its online lending affiliate Lufax, which became profitable last year, delayed a planned IPO this spring, and its Good Doctor IPO in Hong Kong in May fizzled. \
Still, industry insiders are watching for a planned IPO of its subsidiary One_Connect, which sells technology platforms to banks."
