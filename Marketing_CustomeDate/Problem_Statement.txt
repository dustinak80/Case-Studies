Data Challenge Case Study

Background:
You own an E-commerce store that has flourished since its inception, but in the past few years, revenues have remained stagnant and increased spending on advertisements have not yielded expected results. Through membership applications, you have a database of customers with basic demographic and spending information. Additionally, you also have total spending for each customer (in USD).
Problem Statement:

You would like to inform the marketing team on how they should target their customers for their advertisements. You would like to use customer segmentation techniques to find different segments (clusters) of customers to fine-tune the service you offer your customers to better suit their needs. Please document your work clearly using either python or R for your analysis. You should submit your work in a notebook or a Markdown. Please include the following in your analysis:

A.	EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
B.	Clustering technique of your choice (K-means, Hierarchal Clustering, etc.) to identify unique customer segments of data. Please utilize visualizations to make it clear how the resulting segments can inform the marketing team (Age Group, Gender, Interests, etc.)
